 ~ What is FSM ? <br>
 ~ Component of FSM ? <br>
    ~ Next state logic (NSL) : Helps me decide which state to go and what condition <br>
    ~ Output function logic (OSL) : What to do in what state under what condition <br>
    ~ State memory (SM) : Helps me remember what state I'm in <br>
    <br>
 
 ### Rules of FSM:- <br>
 1. Mutually exclusive 
 2. Condition all inclusive
 
#### Writing FSM :- 
1. NSL modeled using if-else statement,
2. Each state is modeled using _Case_ statement,
3. State var's defined using constant, &
4. OFL modeled using conditional assignment.
